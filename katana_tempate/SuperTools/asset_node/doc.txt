Following the suggested convention, the internal file structure of a SuperTool could look something like this:

HelloSuperTool

├─ __init__.py
└─ v1
    ├─ __init__.py
    ├─ Editor.py
    ├─ Node.py
    ├─ ScriptActions.py
    └─ Upgrade.py

The files in a SuperTool are as follows:

• Node.py - the node itself and the public scripting API, which you can test if you get a reference to the node in the Python tab.

• Editor.py - the Qt4 UI (this is only imported in the interactive GUI, not in batch or scripting modes).

• ScriptActions.py - useful functions that are not part of the node API. Since this node is imported by both node and editor, it cannot contain any GUI code.

• Upgrade.py - stub for upgrading the node. This allows compatibility with older versions of the node.
